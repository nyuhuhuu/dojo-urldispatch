# URL dispatcher module for Dojo Toolkit

The module provides a minimal dispatcher class that routes requests to views
given in the routing rules.  It supports named arguments.  Open example
`demo.js` to get an idea how you can use it.

Ideas were borrowed from [Sammy.js][sammy] and [Django's URL dispatcher][django].
